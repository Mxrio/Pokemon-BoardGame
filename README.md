# Pokemon-BoardGame
A luck based version of Pokemon
I created this game before I had any idea of what object oriented programing was and how it worked, reason as to why it is one big file.
I have added notes inside of the file to explain what it goin on in the game and how everything works. 

If you have any question about the game please let me know.
